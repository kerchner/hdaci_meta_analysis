# hdaci_meta_analysis
Meta Analysis group project for PUBH 6863 Fall 2023

- `meta_analysis.Rmd` - main code for meta analysis
- `hazardratio.R` - code in case we need to estimate hazard ratio and its confidence interval based on two groups' median overall survival times and associated confidence intervals; estimate is based on assumption that survival times follow an exponential distribution w/in each group.
